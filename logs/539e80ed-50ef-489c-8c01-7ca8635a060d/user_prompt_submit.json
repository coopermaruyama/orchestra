Consider:\n1. Are all core requirements (Priority 1-2) completed?\n2. Is the main task objective achieved?\n3. Are there any critical issues that need immediate attention?\n\nUse the scope-creep-detector, over-engineering-detector, and off-topic-detector subagents to analyze if the developer is staying focused on the core task.\n\nRespond with JSON in this exact format:\n{\n    \"should_continue\": true/false,\n    \"reason\": \"Brief explanation of why Claude should continue or can stop\",\n    \"focus_area\": \"What the developer should work on next (if continuing)\"\n}\n"
