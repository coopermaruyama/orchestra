# TODO

Internal list of to-dos and improvements for humans

- need to solve the "warm up" time when creating new sessions. even when using "memory", it takes a few back-and-forths sometimes until claude remembers what this project is about.

- one of the frustrating things when using claude is when it thinks its "done" but its not. aligning with claude on an acceptable test case is a good way to avoid this.
