## Plan Review Result: **NEEDS REVISION**

### Summary
The Tidy extension plan shows excellent vision but has critical misalignment with the actual implementation. The plan describes a complex multi-tool detection system while the implementation uses a simpler IDE diagnostics approach.

### Section Review
- **Overview**: ✅ Clear objectives and goals
- **Scope and Constraints**: ⚠️ Present but doesn't match implementation reality
- **Directory Structure**: ❌ Shows files that don't exist (, )
- **File Modifications**: ❌ Missing - no clear list of files to create/modify
- **Implementation Details**: ⚠️ Detailed but describes different architecture than implemented
- **Testing Strategy**: ❌ Completely missing
- **Alternatives Considered**: ❌ Not included

### Required Improvements
1. **Align architecture with reality** - Either update plan to match simpler implementation or implement the complex system
2. **Fix file structure** - Remove references to non-existent files or create them
3. **Add testing strategy** - Include unit tests, integration tests, and validation approach
4. **Clarify dependencies** - Document MCP getDiagnostics and claude_invoker requirements
5. **Add file modifications list** - Specify exact files to create/modify with full paths

### Recommendations
Consider revising the plan to match the current simpler implementation using IDE diagnostics and Claude prompting - it's actually more maintainable than the complex tool detection system described.,
